# FAQ
## How do I start?
- Most of LoTAS is accessible via the in-game pause menu.
- The main menu has a "configuration" button
- Pressing F6 opens an in game HUD, where you can display various information onscreen.

## Can I disable the potion in the hotbar?
No, we do not provide that feature. We want to prevent cheating with our mod and this is our compromise for making it not too annoying. Please live with it and support our fight against cheaters.

## Can this mod record and play back inputs?
No, it can not. This mod was specifically made to not allow for that, hence the "non-playback" in the description. For a playback mod, check [TASmod](https://github.com/MinecraftTAS/TASmod).

## How do I use item duplication?
This differs if you are on versions below 1.12.2 (Forge) or versions higher than 1.14.4 (Fabric)

### 1.14.4-1.20.1
1. Open the pause menu and click in the top left **Save Items**
2. Throw item(s) on the ground
3. Open the pause menu and click in the top left **Load Items**
4. An item should spawn *in your inventory*

### 1.8.9-1.12.2
1. Throw the item(s) you want to duplicate on the ground
2. Open the pause menu and click in the top left **Save Items**
3. Pick up the item(s)
4. Open the pause menu and click in the top left **Load Items**
5. An item should spawn *on the ground*

## Where is the video upspeeder?
This feature that was a minor desaster...  
We decided to remove it, because video editors like [Shotcut](https://shotcut.org) are much better, provide more functionality and happen to work as intended.  

## Why is there no multiplayer?
This mod wasn't developed with multiplayer in mind. The plan was to add it later but this turned out to be *very* tedious. Multiplayer support is/was planned in [LoTAS 3.0](https://github.com/MinecraftTAS/LoTAS/tree/dev-3.0.0)
