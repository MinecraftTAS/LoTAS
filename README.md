# LoTAS Mod
### Low Optimization Tool Assisted Speedrun Mod

LoTAS is a Mod used to create [Tool Assisted Speedruns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool-assisted_speedrun). In Minecraft TASing you use a mod called Tickrate Changer to slow the game down. The Game runs at 20 ticks per second so 10 would be 50% speed.

## How do I start?

Once you installed the Mod and opened a World you can access the TAS Features by pressing `Escape`.
This might look confusing to you, but all you need to know is that the top left buttons + and -, increase or decrease the speed of the game.
Have a look in the [Wiki](https://github.com/MCPfannkuchenYT/LoTAS/wiki) to see the rest of the features explained
