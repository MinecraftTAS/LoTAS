# LoTAS
LoTAS is a mod used for creating **L**ow **o**ptimization **T**ool **A**ssisted **S**peedruns in Minecraft.
This mod contains a bunch of tools that can be used to manipulate the game in various ways, allowing for the creation of TASes.

[!NOTE]
> TASes created with LoTAS cannot be played back, therefore you have to use a [recording software](https://obsproject.com/) to record and speed up your TAS.

## Tools
The tools available in LoTAS 3 are currently very limited, but we are working on adding more tools in the future.
- **Tickrate Changer**: Slow down the game to any speed.
- **Tick Advance**: Pause and advance the game by individual ticks
- **Savestates**: Revert the game to a previous state.
- **Dragon Manipulation**: Manipulate the ender dragons flight path and phase.
- **Dupe Mod**: Duplicate items according to the [dupe glitch](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-63), but without forcefully crashing your game.

## Bugs / Feature Requests
Due to LoTAS not being actively maintained, we do not accept bug reports or feature requests. You are however free to create a pull request with your changes.
